# Backbone.Marionette

Make your Backbone.js apps dance with a composite application architecture!

## This Repository Has Moved

The Backbone.Marionette repository has a new home in the MarionetteJS 
organization on Github, and we're building a website for it.

* https://github.com/marionettejs

* https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette

* http://marionettejs.com

You should be looking at that repository / organization instead of this one.
